# Parallel-Computing-Project

## Code 1: Parallel Prime Number Generation

This code implements a parallel prime number generation algorithm using OpenMP. It calculates and compares execution times, speedup, and efficiency for different numbers of threads. The program prompts the user to input a value N and then finds the largest prime number less than or equal to N.

### Usage:
1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler that supports OpenMP.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Input the value of N.
4. The code will output the largest prime number, execution times, speedup, and efficiency for different numbers of threads.

## Code 2: Sieve of Eratosthenes

This code implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate prime numbers up to a given value N. It calculates and displays the prime numbers and execution time.

### Usage:
1. Compile the code using a C compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. The code will display the prime numbers up to N and the execution time.

## Code 3: Parallel Computing Project Analysis

This code presents an analysis of a parallel computing project involving prime number generation. It includes Python code snippets that generate graphs and analyze the performance of the parallel code for different values of N and numbers of threads.

### Usage:
1. The provided Python code snippets are intended to be used with a Python interpreter.
2. The code snippets generate various graphs that visualize the performance of the parallel prime number generation code for different N values and numbers of threads.

## README for Codes:

### Code 1:
1. Compile the C++ code using an OpenMP-enabled compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Enter the value of N when prompted.
4. The program will output information about the largest prime number, execution times, speedup, and efficiency for different numbers of threads.

### Code 2:
1. Compile the C code using a C compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. The program will display prime numbers up to a specified value N and provide information about the execution time.

### Code 3:
1. These are Python code snippets intended to be used with a Python interpreter.
2. The snippets generate graphs that visualize the execution times, speedup, and efficiency of the parallel prime number generation project for different N values and numbers of threads.

## Important Notes:

1. The code snippets provided in "Code 3" are Python scripts that can be executed in a Python environment.
2. Make sure to have the necessary libraries installed (e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib) to run the Python scripts.
3. The C++ and C codes should be compiled using suitable compilers (e.g., g++, gcc) that support OpenMP for parallel execution.
4. For optimal results, it is recommended to run the codes on a machine with multiple cores or processors to observe the benefits of parallel computing.

Remember that these README instructions are intended to provide an overview of how to use and understand the provided code snippets. Make sure to have the required software and dependencies installed to successfully execute the codes.
